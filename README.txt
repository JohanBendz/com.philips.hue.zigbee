How to transfer light from hue bridge to Homey by Jesper P:
Hue lights are also resettable with the round Hue remote (i.e. Living colors gen 2 Remote).
Delete the specific light in the official iOS Hue app. Then turn on the power of the specific light. Then press the on button and the one dot button on the remote simultaneously, while holding the remote near the light. The light will blink and has been reset. You can now add the light to Homey.

NOTE: If the bulbs have been used with a bridge, or bought as a package with bridge, prior to connecting them directly to Homey. You will need to reset the bulb with the Philips Hue bridge before being able to add them. You can also reset the bulb with a Philips Hue Remote (8718696743157).

I would like to credit Richard Slater for his icons that where used when creating this app (https://thenounproject.com/richard.slater)
